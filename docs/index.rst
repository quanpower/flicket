Flicket Documentation
======================

Flicket is a simple web based ticketing system written in Python using
the flask web framework which supports English and French locales.


Why Flicket?
---------------
I could not find a simple open source ticketing system that I really liked.
So, decided to have a crack at creating something written in Python.
